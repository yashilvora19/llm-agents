    """
    This project assigned to me by Aira Technologies aims to build an LLM agent to chat with a wildfire dataset. I am using the OpenAI API 
    and GPT-4 model to communicate with my data.

    Since my data was stored as a SQLite database, I first wrote some queries to get an idea of what it looked like.

    Following this, I converted it to a Pandas dataframe and made use of the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` in the langchain 
    framework in order to build my LLM agent. After getting my API key and loading some money into my account, I ran some prompts 
    through this agent and got some interesting results. Scroll to the end of the page to see them!
